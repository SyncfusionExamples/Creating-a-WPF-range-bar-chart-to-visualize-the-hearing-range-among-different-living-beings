# Creating a WPF range bar chart to visualize the hearing range among different living beings.

## Description
The [WPF Range Bar Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/charts/wpf-range-column-chart) is a horizontal range column chart that uses range bars to display values for one or more items based on high and low values. The range bar chart is also known as a dumbbell chart.

## Customization
By default, range bar charts plot discrete rectangles for the given high and low values. The shape of the series can be customized using [SegmentSpacing](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ColumnSeries_SegmentSpacing) and [Interior](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Interior) properties.

## Data Label and Marker
To improve readability, the chart data labels and markers can be activated and customized using [AdornmentsInfo](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.AdornmentSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_AdornmentSeries_AdornmentsInfo).

This article demonstrates how to create and customize the WPF Range Bar Chart to visualize the hearing range for different living beings on Earth.
